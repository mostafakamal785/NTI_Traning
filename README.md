# 🚀 NTI Web Development Journey (17 Days)

Welcome to my **NTI Full-Stack Web Development Learning Journey**.
This repository documents everything I’ve learned, practiced, and built — day by day — from **JavaScript basics** to **advanced backend development** with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, and more**.

Each folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, …) contains:

* Code samples and exercises
* Notes and key takeaways
* A `README.md` file summarizing that day’s content

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* Build a strong foundation in **JavaScript** and **Node.js**
* Understand the **client-server model** and **HTTP communication**
* Create modular and maintainable **Express APIs**
* Use **MongoDB** and **Mongoose** for real-world data models
* Implement **authentication, validation, and security**
* Learn to **collaborate in teams** using Git & GitHub
* Optimize backend apps with **Redis caching and logging**

---

## 🧩 Team Project Highlight — Audio Library API

The **Audio Library Sharing API** was a team-built backend project that combined:

* Authentication & Authorization
* File Uploads (audio + image)
* Audio Streaming via `fs.createReadStream`
* Role-based Admin features
* Redis caching and centralized logging
* Error handling and validation middleware

This project represented the **culmination** of all skills learned across the NTI program.

---

## 📈 My Progress Reflection

By Day 17, I have:

* Built multiple APIs using **Express + MongoDB**
* Designed clean project structures following the **MVC pattern**
* Learned **Redis, Winston, and JWT** for real-world backend reliability
* Improved team collaboration and version control habits
* Moved from basic JS understanding → full backend confidence 💪

---

## 🏁 Next Steps

* Learn **backend testing** (Jest, Postman automation)
* Dive into **TypeScript** for type safety
* Explore **Docker & CI/CD** for deployment
* Build a **personal project** that combines all technologies
